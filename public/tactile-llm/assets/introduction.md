# Introduction

In this study, you will learn how to understand **two different chart types**. We will first teach you the basics of each chart type using instructions. During the learning, you can ask an **LLM-based chatbot** any questions. Then, you will use the chatbot to help you explore an example alt text of that chart type, and finally a more complex dataset presented in that chart type. The goal is to understand how BLV participants learn new chart types and how a chatbot can support that learning during dataset exploration.

You will learn the two chart types in this order:

- **Violin plot**: You will learn this chart type using **tactile instructions**.
- **Clustered heatmap**: You will learn this chart type using a **textual explanation**.
