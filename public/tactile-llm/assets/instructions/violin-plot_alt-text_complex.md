# Violin Plot Alt-Text

This is a violin plot showing the distribution of the Human Development Index (HDI) across five continents, Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, based on data from 2021\. The HDI aims to capture the overall well-being and development of countries based on health, education, and standard of living. Europe exhibits the highest and most consistent HDI values, while Asia has the widest variability. Africa and Oceania have non-normal  distributions, indicating groups of countries with different levels of development. HDI is measured from 0 (low) to 1 (high).

## Distribution Properties

* **Africa:**   
  * The distribution is not a normal distribution but has a wider part at the upper end, in addition to a peak in the middle.   
  * The majority of African countries have HDI values concentrated around the median of **0.54**, forming a primary peak.   
  * A smaller wider section  is observed around **0.73**, indicating a group of countries with higher HDI.   
  * The distribution is relatively spread out, spanning from **0.39 to 0.80**.  
* **Americas:**   
  * The distribution is unimodal and symmetrical, peaking around the median **0.75**.   
  * Most countries' HDI values are concentrated between **0.71 and 0.80**, with fewer extreme values, reflecting a less spread out level of human development across the region.  
* **Asia:**   
  * The distribution is unimodal but highly dispersed, with HDI values spanning from **0.46 to 0.95**, the widest range among all continents.   
  * The violin is relatively thin with no strong peak indicating that HDI values vary substantially across Asian countries.  
* **Europe:**   
  * The distribution is unimodal but asymmetrical, with a clear peak above the median at **0.89**.   
  * Europe has the highest median HDI among all continents and the smallest range (**0.77 to 0.96**), suggesting high and consistent levels of human development.  
* **Oceania:**   
  * The distribution is elongated and not normal bimodal, with a primary peak around the median of **0.64** and a smaller wider part near **0.94**.  
  * The range is broad (**0.56 to 0.95**), indicating variation in human development levels within the region.
