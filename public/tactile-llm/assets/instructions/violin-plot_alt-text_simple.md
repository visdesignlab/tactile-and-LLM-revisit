# Violin Plot Alt-Text (Example)

This is a violin plot showing the distribution of body mass (in pounds) across three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. 

- **Y-axis:** Body mass (pounds).
- **X-axis:** Species, from left to right: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, **Gentoo**.
- **Violins:** Each violin shows the distribution of body mass for that species.

**Overall pattern:** 
Adelie and Chinstrap have unimodal distributions with similar median values. Gentoo shows a bimodal distribution and a higher median than the other two species.
