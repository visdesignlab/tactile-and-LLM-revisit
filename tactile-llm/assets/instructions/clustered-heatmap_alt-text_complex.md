# Clustered Heatmap Alt-Text

This is a **clustered heatmap** showing how citizens in **15 European countries** rate the relative importance of **9 sociocultural, institutional, and religious topics** (for example, **confidence in government**, **belief in God**, and **attitudes toward homosexuality**) based on a survey.

- **Rows:** Countries.
- **Columns:** Topics.
- **Cells (color intensity):** The agreement level for each country–topic pair. Darker cells indicate higher agreement, and lighter cells indicate lower agreement.
- **Clustering:** Both countries and topics are **clustered by similarity**. A **hierarchical tree (dendrogram)** next to the rows shows which countries cluster together (shorter branch distances indicate more similar response patterns). Another dendrogram above the columns shows which topics cluster together.

On a high level, the Nordic countries are the most confident in state institutions and most liberal. Religious values are strongest in Russia, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece and Portugal. Poland, Italy, and Russia are most conservative on social issues.
