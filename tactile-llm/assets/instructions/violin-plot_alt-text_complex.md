# Violin Plot Alt-Text

This is a violin plot showing the distribution of the Human Development Index (HDI) for countries in 2021, grouped by continent: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.

- **Title:** Human Development Index (HDI) Distributions by Continent (2021)
- **Y-axis:** HDI, ranging from 0 (low) to 1 (high).
- **X-axis:** Continents.
- **Violins:** Each violin shows how countries’ HDI values are distributed within that continent (wider sections indicate more countries at that HDI level). A central marker indicates the median.

Europe exhibits the highest and most consistent HDI values, while Asia has the widest variability. Africa and Oceania have non-normal  distributions, indicating groups of countries with different levels of development. HDI is measured from 0 (low) to 1 (high).
