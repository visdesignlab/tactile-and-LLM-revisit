# Violin Plot Alt-Text (Example)

This is a violin plot showing the distribution of body mass (in pounds) across three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. While **Adelie and Chinstrap penguins exhibit unimodal distributions with similar median values**, Gentoo penguins show a **bimodal distribution and a higher median.**

---

* **Y-axis:** Represents body mass in pounds.   
* **X-axis:** Lists the three penguin species from left to right: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**.   
* Three violins each shows the distribution of body masses for a species

## Distribution Properties

* **Adelie penguins:** The distribution is unimodal, and it has one peak in the middle. Most Adelie penguins’ body mass is concentrated close to the median (8.16 pounds).  
* **Chinstrap penguins:** The distribution is also unimodal, with a single peak in the middle. Most Chinstrap penguins' body masses are concentrated close to the median (8.18 pounds), and their weights are more tightly clustered near the middle compared to Adelie penguins.  
* **Gentoo penguins:** The median body mass of Gentoo penguins is 11.02 pounds, which is larger than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. The distribution is bimodal. Gentoo penguins' body masses are concentrated around 10.5 pounds and 12 pounds, which form the two peaks.
