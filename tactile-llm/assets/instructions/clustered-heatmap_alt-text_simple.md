# Clustered Heatmap Alt-Text (Example)

This is a **clustered heatmap** showing how frequently actors appear in different movie genres.

- **Rows:** Actors.  
- **Columns:** Movie genres.  
- **Cells (color intensity):** The number of appearances for each actor–genre pair. **Darker** cells indicate **more** appearances, and **lighter** cells indicate **fewer** (or none).  
- **Clustering:** Actors and genres are **clustered by similarity**. A **hierarchical tree (dendrogram)** next to the rows shows which actors cluster together (shorter branch distances indicate more similar genre-appearance patterns). Another dendrogram above the columns shows which genres cluster together.

**Overall pattern:** 
* Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks show similar patterns, focusing primarily on Drama and Comedy  
* Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio share a strong emphasis on Drama  
* Dwayne Johnson is  an outlier in this dataset, with a strong specialization in Action and no Romance films
